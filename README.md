# UnityWebGL-XUMM-Login

## Intro
Simple Unity WebGL login method to use XUMM wallet login for XRPL.  Returns the user's wallet address into Unity to be used.

This was created in Unity 2021.3.5f1 so I can't guarentee compatibility with other versions but I will check over time.

## Setup
Import the pack into your Project, better to play with a blank one first.

Go into the Scenes folder inside the Asset's directory and open up the Scene there.

Follow the instructions written in the scene which is just entering your XUMM App's API Key into the variable in the LoginHandler.

Build it for WebGL and you are done....
